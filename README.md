Using Statcast data to compare two baseball player statistics

Using a new technology called Statcast, Major League Baseball is now collecting the precise location and movements of its baseballs and players. In this project, we use Statcast data to compare the home runs of two of baseball's brightest (and largest) stars, Aaron Judge (6'7") and Giancarlo Stanton (6'6").

The dataset used in this project is from Baseball Savant.
